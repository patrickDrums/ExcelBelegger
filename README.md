A Excel AddIn to become a better investor

Currently work in progress, wanted to see what's possible with an Excel plugin. The current functionality consists of importing a CSV file from a broker called DEGIRO. It imports as a table and highlights certain parts based on if it's a buy/sell/dividend transaction.

On the wishlist is the functionality to update my current proftolio tracker by just importing the CSV. Now I still need to manually copy the hightlighted data.
